This a continuing series of posts that goes through the steps I took to redesign my website. From idea, to design and then development. The posts are split up into stages and in order. But each post covers a particular topic an is written to stand on it's own. I'm hoping that with every post there are some things you can learn from as well.

- [Reasons, wants, needs and why](/reasons-wants-needs-and-why/)
- [Why you should create content before starting design](/why-create-content-before-design/)
- _More posts coming soon_
