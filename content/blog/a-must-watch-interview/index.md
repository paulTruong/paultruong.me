I just watched an interview with Jeremy Keith by Smashing magazine. And I think it’s the most important video of recent years for web developers to watch. Smashing magazine asks a lot of great questions and Jeremy provides some very thoughtful answers that fully embrace what the web is about.

One thing he says that I strongly agree with is that, technically with the advancement of browsers and hardware, the web has never been in a better place. But because of this, websites are more bloated and harder to use than ever before. And it is up to us developers to change that and work to make the web more usable again.

Watch the video and I’m sure you’ll find yourself nodding your head in agreement with everything Jeremy says.
