        Hi!
        <br />
        I'm Paul and welcome to my site.
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am currently working as a Wordpress web developer but my interests go
        far* beyond that.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when it comes to websites, I believe in simple, focused and
        strategic websites over complicated, fancy and confusing ones.
