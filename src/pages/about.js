        My name is Paul and I'm a web developer with a deep love for design and illustration. I use what I learn to help create websites that everyone can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in the power of simplicity. That a simple design that everyone can benefit from is much more impressive than a complex design that only some people will understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of work, I love video games, hip hop, art and anime. I'm also learning as much as I can to become a better designer and illustrator because I've found that I am much more excited about problems that can be solved by amazing visuals rather than problems that require complex algorithms.
