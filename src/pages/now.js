    <h1>What I'm up to right now</h1>
    <p>
      I'm the kind of guy that gets bored easily and am always trying to find something new to do. Here is what I'm spending most of my time on right now.
    </p>
    <div style={{ margin: `0 0 2rem 0` }}>
      <h2>Working for a not for profit</h2>
      <p>
        I've been a web developer for Diabetes Australia for the past 2 years now. It's a great job, working with great people and I get a good sense of fulfillment from it.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning how to make paint environments</h2>
      <p>I am going through Marciej Kuciara's <a href="https://www.learnsquared.com/courses/intro-env-paint#">Intro to Environment Painting</a> course.</p>
      <p>Wait...</p>
      <p>What does environment concept art have to do with web development and design...?</p>
      <p>Absolutely nothing. And that's okay.</p>
      <p>Prior to graduating year 12, I had dreams of becoming a concept artist but instead I spent a good chunk of my early twenties working a 'real' job. I don't want to be a concept artist anymore but I've always loved the art created for the entertainment industries. I also tend to have a compulsion to go deep and learn how to do the things that I love.</p>
      <p>So this year I have committed to learning drawing, painting and illustration. Because I love it.</p>
      <h2>Writing blog posts</h2>
      <p>Some of you might have started reading my blog series on the process I took to redesign my website. I am continuing to write articles for that series.
      </p>
      <h2>The other important things</h2>
      <p>
        In between work, learning and writing. I am finding time to do the other things in life that are important to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        That includes spending time with my girlfriend, checking in on my parents, brother and sister, talking trash with my mates and, of course, playing a few games of Overwatch every now and   again.
